# Project Governance

This document lays out the guidelines under which the Capsule project will be governed.
The goal is to make sure that the roles and responsibilities are well defined and clarify how decisions are made.

## Roles

In the context of Capsule project, we consider the following roles:

* __Users__: everyone using Capsule, typically willing to provide feedback by proposing features and/or filing issues.

* __Contributors__: everyone contributing code, documentation, examples, tests, and participating in feature proposals as well as design discussions.

* __Maintainers__: are responsible for engaging with and assisting contributors to iterate on the contributions until it reaches acceptable quality. Maintainers can decide whether the contributions can be accepted into the project or rejected.

## Release Management

The release process will be governed by Maintainers.

Please, refer to the [maintainers file](https://github.com/projectcapsule/capsule/blob/master/.github/maintainers.yaml) available in the source code.

## Roadmap Planning

Maintainers will share roadmap and release versions as milestones in GitHub.
