The configuration for the capsule controller is done via it's dedicated configration Custom Resource. You can explain the configuration options and how to use them:



## CapsuleConfiguration

The configuration for Capsule is done via it's dedicated configration Custom Resource. You can explain the configuration options and how to use them:

```bash
kubectl explain capsuleConfiguration.spec
```

### enableTLSReconciler
Toggles the TLS reconciler, the controller that is able to generate CA and certificates for the webhooks when not using an already provided CA and certificate, or when these are managed externally with Vault, or cert-manager.

### forceTenantPrefix
Enforces the Tenant owner, during Namespace creation, to name it using the selected Tenant name as prefix, separated by a dash. This is useful to avoid Namespace name collision in a public CaaS environment.

### nodeMetadata
Allows to set the forbidden metadata for the worker nodes that could be patched by a Tenant. This applies only if the Tenant has an active NodeSelector, and the Owner have right to patch their nodes.

### overrides
Allows to set different name rather than the canonical one for the Capsule configuration objects, such as webhook secret or configurations.

### protectedNamespaceRegex
Disallow creation of namespaces, whose name matches this regexp

### userGroups
Names of the groups for Capsule users. Users must have this group to be considered for the Capsule tenancy. If a user does not have any group mentioned here, they are not recognized as a Capsule user.

### userNames
Names of the users for Capsule users. Users must have this name to be considered for the Capsule tenancy. If userGroups are set, the properties are ORed, meaning that a user can be recognized as a Capsule user if they have one of the groups or one of the names.

### ignoreUserWithGroups
Define groups which when found in the request of a user will be ignored by the Capsule. This might be useful if you have one group where all the users are in, but you want to separate administrators from normal users with additional groups.

## Controller Options

Depending on the version of the Capsule Controller, the configuration options may vary. You can view the options for the latest version of the Capsule Controller or by executing the controller locally:

$ docker run ghcr.io/projectcapsule/capsule:v0.6.0-rc0 -h
