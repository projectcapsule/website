Our commitment is to deliver a robust, stable Tenancy specification that serves as a foundational platform for a wide range of automation use cases in multi-tenant environments. Rather than focusing on niche scenarios, our project addresses the fundamental aspects that are universally required, including:

* **Streamlined Permissions Management**: Efficiently governing access control across diverse namespaces (tenants).
* **Comprehensive Resource Oversight**: Facilitating seamless resource management across multiple tenants.
* **Exceptional User Experience**: Prioritizing intuitive design and ease of use.
* **Clear and Consistent API Specification**: Empowering developers with a transparent and reliable interface.
* **Community-Driven Automation**: Enabling and encouraging further automation initiatives from the community.

Please note, this project is offered without any warranty, and support is provided on a best-effort basis.
